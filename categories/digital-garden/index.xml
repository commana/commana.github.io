      <description>The C programming language can be difficult for developers that are used to high-level concepts and libraries from their favorite language. At least for me, going &amp;ldquo;back&amp;rdquo; to C from languages like Java or JavaScript feels daunting.
Since I decided to write programs in the spirit of Donald Knuth, I took on two projects that I am going to write in C: an image viewer with programming language support &amp;ndash; where the programming language will be the second project.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I write an average of five new programs every week. Poets have to write poems. I have to write computer programs.&amp;rdquo; -Donald Knuth
 Recently, I realized that I haven&amp;rsquo;t been creating real programs for quite some time. I have been creating lots of throwaway scripts, sure, but nothing that felt like a real program. Something that you could give to another person and they would find it useful.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my site, stranger! Happy to have you here.
My first &amp;ldquo;home page&amp;rdquo; went online shortly after I got access to the Internet, which was approximately in 1997. I&amp;rsquo;ve maintained my site through high school first using Microsoft Frontpage, then later I taught myself HTML and CSS to design my web page. Back in the day, everybody had their personal space, for example, with a link section to other interesting sites.</description>
